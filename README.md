🔍 IDOR & BOLA — Layer by Layer

📌 Why This Repo Exists

Most people jump straight to “IDOR” or “BOLA” without understanding how we even get there.
This repo is not just definitions — it’s about thinking like a real hacker:
Step by step, layer by layer, until we see exactly where the lock is and how to break it.

⸻

🪜 Step 1 — Start From the Core: Authorization

Forget the names for a moment.
At the heart of every IDOR or BOLA is authorization.

Authorization = deciding “Can this user do this action on this resource?”
	•	If it’s broken or missing, we can act as someone else.
	•	That’s it — this is what IDOR and BOLA are really about.

⸻

🪜 Step 2 — Who and What Handles Authorization?

Authorization isn’t magic. It happens through:
	1.	Frontend — where you click or type (browser, app).
	2.	Backend — where business logic lives.
	3.	API — the connection between them, the lock on the door.

⸻

🪜 Step 3 — The API: The Real Battlefield

Every request from the frontend goes through the API before reaching the backend.
This is where all the action happens — and where we test.

Think of the API as a waiter:
	•	Frontend (You): “I want this dish.”
	•	API (Waiter): Takes your request to the kitchen.
	•	Backend (Kitchen): Prepares the result.
	•	API (Waiter): Brings it back to you.

BOLA/IDOR happens when you can trick the waiter into giving you a dish that belongs to someone else.

⸻

🪜 Step 4 — Why We Must Understand the API First

You can’t hunt BOLA or IDOR without knowing:
	•	How APIs receive and process requests.
	•	Where authorization checks should happen.
	•	How to tamper with IDs, parameters, and endpoints.

APIs have a skeleton:
	1.	Imports & setup
	2.	Define the server/app
	3.	Define endpoints
	4.	Handle requests
	5.	Send responses
	6.	Run server
 🪜 Step 5 — Finally, IDOR and BOLA

Once you know where authorization should be, you can start tampering:
	•	Change IDs in the path (/users/123 → /users/124).
	•	Change IDs in query parameters (?id=123).
	•	Change IDs in JSON bodies.
	•	Try accessing resources you don’t own.

IDOR = Direct object reference without a check.
BOLA = Same thing in APIs, at the object level.

🛡 Our Goal in This Repo
	•	Learn authorization first.
	•	Understand API flow.
	•	See where BOLA/IDOR appear.
	•	Learn how to test and prevent them.
